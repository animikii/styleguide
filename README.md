# Animikii Style Guide
Welcome to the Animikii style guide where we layout our code conventions, patterns and solutions to problems we encounter.

Please keep in mind that **master** is the production branch. If you merge anything to the **master** branch it will be pushed.

**Note: if you need review, make a pull request and assign to the person(s) you would like to review.**
